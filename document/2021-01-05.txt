What is git ? and why to use it ?

Git is a VCS ( version control system ) that is used to handle small projects as well as large projects. It stores all the versions of our project. We can easily work in team on one project using git.
We can even get the previous states of our project if we get any error.

What I learnt ?

First of all I created an account in GitHub. Then I installed git. 
Then I basically started to learn git.
So first , we can use git init command to track a project on local machine. It generally provide the git facility to maintain project on local machine.
Then I created a private repository in my account named “my-repo”. 
After that I created ssh key to provide communication between GitHub and my laptop. Generally ssh key provide our laptop’s identification to github. So we don’t have to provide our identity every time.
I generated ssh key using  $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "lalwanirohit111@gmail.com"

Then I displayed that key using $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Then I found that we can also copy the ssh key directly to our clipboard using 
$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Then I copied the ssh key and registered that key in my GitHub account. 

Then I created a directory in my server directory.
 
Then I cloned my private repository into my server directory using 
$ git clone git@github.com:lalwanirohit/my-repo.git

While cloning my repository I got an unexpected message that 

The authenticity of host 'github.com (13.234.210.38)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 

Then I try to solve that error by getting some information about it. So I found that we can solve this error by two ways. First is we should use https: url and second is we can type yes after checking the public fingerprint key of GitHub.

So I checked the public fingerprint key of GitHub and then I typed yes.

then i went into directory where i cloned my private repository using  cd directory_name command.

after that i used  $ git remote -v to check the nick name of my repository. it was origin

then i learn how to create branch in our project 

so to create branch in our project we can use  $ git checkout -b my-repo-sub-branch origin/main. here my-repo-sub-branch is name of branch and origin is the main branch.

then we will be in our sub branch. there i created a php file and wrote some code there. 
then used $ git status 

to add our untracked files in staged status we can use $ git add file_name command.

after adding the file into staged area we have to commit. to do that use $ git commit -m "message". 

after that we have to push all the data in our GitHub repository. yo do that we can use $ git push origin my-repo-sub-branch. 

at this time our changes and files are in sub branch and it will be not visible in main branch.

then we have to perform merging of sub branch in our main branch. 
we can do that by two commands.

$ git fetch origin
$ git merge --no-ff origin/my-repo-sub-branch

after this two commands we have to push the changes in our main branch using push command.

this will merge our sub branch to the main branch and now our files will be visible in main branch.
