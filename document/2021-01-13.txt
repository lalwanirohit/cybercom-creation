querySelector ()

- querySelector () is a method which is used to get the element that matches the selector from document.
- we can get elements based on given class and id to the elements. 
- query Selector will only return the first element that mathces the selector so be very careful while giving class name and id to the elements. 
-syntax : 
	querySelector('selector')
-example:
	querySelector('.head')  

- here in example it will return the first element which will have the head class.
-to select all the elements which have same class as selrctor then use "querySelectorAll()	".
